				<p>"<em>I'm not into working out. I actually hate to sweat.</em> During COVID I decided that instead of watching workout videos I should start doing them. I knew I needed accountability though and I wanted tips, ensure I had the correct form, etc. I didn't want to get injured and I wanted results.</p>
				<p>I figured nothing would change without doing something different. So I asked a friend if we could train together. My goals - more muscle, better balance, less cellulite. Even within 2 weeks my mom noticed a difference. Lee explains and demonstrates the proper way to do an exercise. He will help you modify an exercise if you have poor knees, like me.</p>
				<p>Grateful I took action. If something is in your court to make better and you want it, you should carve out the time and resources. I did, it's been great."</p> 

				<p class="testimonial-attribution">-Heather K.</p>
				<p>"<em>I have always had a passion for fitness but have had a difficult time finding the proper way to train.</em> A few years back, I decided to make a serious change so I signed up for personal training at my local gym. I wanted to enjoy the process and push myself while working through some injuries. I dreaded training at first. I didn’t find my original trainer motivating during the short time we had together or driven to help me reach my goals which was discouraging. When making a switch, I looked for a big charismatic guy, one I could tell was training as hard as I wanted to be pushed and had an equal passion for training. Lee was that guy.</p>  
				<p>When I first started training with Lee, my goals were to strengthen my lower back, a more lifted butt and pushups. While I was hoping for big results, I wasn’t convinced I could achieve them. Lee saw my potential and taught me to love myself and the process, not just idea of an outcome. He developed a program that challenged me and was also enjoyable. This helps me stay consistent with my goals when training outside of our sessions.</p>
						<p>Lee’s training style goes beyond lifting. He helped me to create a lifestyle which helped me address the numerous excuses I allowed to hold me back in the past; not enough time, proper nutrition, effective supplements, difficulty adapting, too tired, unreasonable mindsets. When I’ve encountered obstacles in the process, Lee has always been easily approachable with an encouraging word and solution to keep me going. I have achieved far more than physical strength in the past year and look forward to continued growth.</p>
				<p>Wherever you are in the training process, Lee will meet you where you’re at without judgment. You can expect to get as much out of the process as you put in with him!"</p>
				<p class="testimonial-attribution">-Sarah P.</p>
				<p>"<em>Lee has been my dear friend (and man crush) for over 15 years. In the last few years he has also been a tremendous source of inspiration and knowledge for health & fitness.</em> In 2019 I lost 50 pounds and have kept it off since and one of the biggest reasons I was able to lose the weight and keep it off was because Lee showed me that it's much more about a lifestyle change than a "diet". It's about addressing your relationship to food, why you've struggled before, and finding the path that best suits you. Because of his neverending guidance and support I've been living a body that's much healthier more productive and much much happier. I can’t thank my brother enough. Much love!"</p>
